# WeatherStation
Raspberry Pi Weather Station

As of July, 2021, I've spent a little over a year off and on developing this weather station. It hangs on the wall in my living room. It was my first python project. I used nano in the console to edit everything and have recently started doing all the web development in VS Code and its a night and day difference. I'll never go back. Originally I was hesitant to do any development in an IDE because to test the code, I have to FTP it back to the Pi and run it remotely, but the time saved by using VS Code more than makes up for it. The whole project was a very ambitious one as I had almost no experience programming in python. 

As of the time of this writing, I don't know how to make any install scripts so if you download and run this, there may be some editing required and/or making sure directories are in the right place. Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
